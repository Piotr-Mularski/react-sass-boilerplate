# A Sassy and Reactive Webpack boilerplate
## Description

This is a simple webpack boilerplate setup with the usage of React and Sass. It converts .scss files to .css, ES6+ JavaScript to pre ES6 JS and compile React JSX code to HTML. Nothing fancy, but most importantly, it actually works which isn't always the case with webpack ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)

## Installation and usage

To install all necessary dependencies, simply use your favourite package installer (that means Yarn). For example while in the boilerplate folder use the command `yarn install` in the command line. To create a /dist folder with compressed files use `yarn build`, and to run server environment use `yarn start:dev`. You can also run `yarn start` after the `yarn build` to run pre-configured node server (on the port 3000).
